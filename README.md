# CPP_Lab1
The first lab in my C++ programming course. Used a bubble sort for extra credit.
The code is probably longer than it needs to be, and it wasn't specifically 
requested to check all characters in the names, but I wanted to start with 
functions and learn a bit about how input validation works on C++.
